# Download and Installation     

The latest OSATE release can be downloaded from 
[here](http://aadl.info/aadl/osate/stable/latest/products/).

## New Installation

OSATE is available for Windows (32-bit and 64-bit), Mac OSX (64-bit),
and Linux (64-bit). As a prerequisite Java 8 is required; in the
following we assume that it is already installed. See
[here](https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml) for help
with installing Java.

To install OSATE, download the archive file for your platform from the
OSATE download site (see below), choose an installation directory and
unpack the archive file there. The installation directory contains a
platform specific executable (osate.exe / osate.app / osate) that can be
used to start the OSATE.

### Detailed Installation for Windows

The OSATE distribution for Windows is packaged as a zip file, e.g.,
**osate2-2.2.1-vfinal-win32.win32.x86.zip** for the 32-bit version and
**osate2-2.2.1-vfinal-win32.win32.x86\_64.zip** for the 64-bit version. Which
of these is needed depends on the installed Java version: 32-bit Java
must use 32-bit OSATE and 64-bit Java must use 64-bit OSATE. To test
which one is installed, run `java -version` in cmd.exe. The following
output indicates 32-bit Java.

```
C:\Users\lwrage>java -version
java version "1.8.0_51"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_51-b16)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 25.51-b03, mixed mode, sharing)
```

A 64-bit Java will output "64-bit Server VM" instead of "Client VM".

After downloading the appropriate zip file from the OSATE download site,
extract the zip file to an empty target directory, e.g.,
C:\\Tools\\OSATE. After extraction the target directory will contain
some sub-directories and files, including osate.exe:

## Updating OSATE

An existing OSATE installation can be updated when a new maintenance release has been published. We support updates within
the same OSATE version from the final release to a maintenance release and from one maintenance release to the next.
For example,

2.2.1.vfinal -> 2.2.1.vupdate01 -> 2.2.1.vupdate02 -> ...

To start the update process, use the check for updates entry in the help menu in OSATE and follow the instructions in
the dialog.
